# RecipeRadar - Security Vulnerability Assessment

This document outlines potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement within the RecipeRadar application. While the app employs several security best practices, this assessment is intended to guide future hardening efforts for a production environment.

---

## 1. Authentication & Session Management

### 1.1. Session Management
- **Vulnerability:** While sessions are securely stored in the database, they are not automatically rotated or invalidated when a user logs in or changes their password.
- **Risks:** If an attacker gains access to a valid session token, they could potentially maintain access even after the legitimate user logs in again from a different device.
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** The `loginAction` and `changePasswordAction` now invalidate all other active sessions for a user upon success. This ensures that a new login or a password change logs out all other potentially compromised sessions, significantly improving account security.

### 1.2. Insecure Admin Authentication
- **Vulnerability:** ~~The primary administrator login is handled by comparing user input against plaintext environment variables (`ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`).~~
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** The environment variable-based login has been removed. All users, including administrators, must now log in via the standard, secure database authentication flow. An admin is designated by an `is_admin = true` flag in the `users` table.

## 2. Authorization & Access Control

### 2.1. Decentralized Authorization Checks
- **Vulnerability:** ~~Authorization logic (e.g., `if (!user?.isAdmin)`) is scattered across numerous server actions.~~
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** Authorization logic has been centralized. Helper functions like `getAuthenticatedUser()` and `getAdminUser()` are now used at the beginning of server actions. These functions handle authentication and role verification in one place, throwing an error and halting execution if the checks fail. This significantly reduces the risk of forgetting an authorization check.

### 2.2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Vulnerability:** ~~Several actions rely on the client to provide the correct ID for an object (e.g., `deleteCommentAction(commentId)`). The security relies entirely on the server-side check that ensures the logged-in user is the `author_id` of that comment.~~
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** Server actions that modify or delete content have been refactored to include ownership checks directly within the SQL query's `WHERE` clause (e.g., `... WHERE id = $1 AND author_id = $2`). This ensures that an operation will only succeed if the object ID matches *and* the current user is the owner, effectively preventing users from affecting objects they do not own.

## 3. Input Validation & Injection Attacks

### 3.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Current Mitigation:** React's JSX rendering automatically escapes data, which is a strong defense against stored XSS in the primary UI.
- **Potential Risk:**
    - **Email Generation:** The `sendEmail` function could be a vector for XSS if complex, user-generated HTML is ever included in templates without proper sanitization.
- **Mitigation:** **[PARTIALLY FIXED]** The current email templates are simple text and basic HTML, which significantly reduces the risk. However, it's a best practice to always sanitize any user-generated content before embedding it in emails.

### 3.2. SQL Injection
- **Current Mitigation:** The application consistently uses parameterized queries via the `pg` library (e.g., `client.query('... WHERE id = $1', [userId])`). This is the industry-standard defense against SQL Injection and is implemented correctly throughout the data access layer.
- **Potential Risk:** This is currently a low-risk area, but it's critical to maintain this discipline. Any future developer who deviates from this pattern and uses string concatenation to build a SQL query from user input would immediately introduce a critical SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** Enforce a strict policy of using parameterized queries for all database interactions. Code reviews should specifically check for this.

## 4. Rate Limiting

- **Vulnerability:** Sensitive actions like login, OTP requests, and password resets lacked robust, IP-based rate limiting.
- **Risks:**
    - **Brute-Force Attacks:** An attacker could rapidly try to guess a user's password or OTP.
    - **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker could spam endpoints, potentially incurring costs or getting services blocked.
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** A database-backed, IP-based rate limiting system has been implemented in `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`. This system tracks requests for sensitive actions from individual IP addresses and will block them if they exceed a configured limit, providing robust protection against brute-force and spam attacks.
