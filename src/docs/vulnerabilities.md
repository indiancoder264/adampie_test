# RecipeRadar - Security Vulnerability Assessment

This document outlines potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement within the RecipeRadar application. While the app employs several security best practices, this assessment is intended to guide future hardening efforts for a production environment.

---

## 1. Authentication & Session Management

### 1.1. Session Token Vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability:** The session management relies on a simple JSON object stored in an `httpOnly` cookie. While `httpOnly` prevents direct access via client-side JavaScript (mitigating XSS-based token theft), the session token itself has weaknesses.
- **Risks:**
    - **No Server-Side Expiration:** The session token doesn't have a server-enforced expiration date. It only expires when the browser cookie does. An attacker who compromises a token could potentially use it for up to a week.
    - **Session Fixation:** There's no mechanism to regenerate the session cookie upon login or privilege escalation (like changing a password), which could make session fixation attacks theoretically possible.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a robust, server-side session management system. Store session IDs in the cookie and corresponding session data in the database or a Redis cache with a server-enforced Time-To-Live (TTL).

### 1.2. Insecure Admin Authentication
- **Vulnerability:** ~~The primary administrator login is handled by comparing user input against plaintext environment variables (`ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`).~~
- **Risks:**
    - ~~**Exposure of Credentials:** Storing a plaintext password in an environment variable is a high-risk practice. If the environment variables are ever exposed, the admin account is immediately compromised.~~
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** The environment variable-based login has been removed. All users, including administrators, must now log in via the standard, secure database authentication flow. An admin is designated by an `is_admin = true` flag in the `users` table.

## 2. Authorization & Access Control

### 2.1. Decentralized Authorization Checks
- **Vulnerability:** Authorization logic (e.g., `if (!user?.isAdmin)`) is scattered across numerous server actions.
- **Risks:**
    - **Human Error:** It is very easy for a developer to forget to add an authorization check to a new server action, immediately creating a security hole. For example, if a new admin-only action is created without the `isAdmin` check, any logged-in user could potentially call it.
    - **Inconsistent Checks:** Different parts of the app might implement checks slightly differently, leading to subtle bugs and potential bypasses.
- **Recommendation:** Centralize authorization logic. This could be achieved by creating higher-order functions or middleware that wrap server actions, checking for required roles (e.g., `withAdminAuth(myAction)`) before executing the core logic.

## 3. Input Validation & Injection Attacks

### 3.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Current Mitigation:** React's JSX rendering automatically escapes data, which is a strong defense against stored XSS in the primary UI.
- **Potential Risk:**
    - **Email Generation:** ~~The `sendVerificationEmail` function directly includes variables like `name` and `email` in the HTML body. An attacker with a malicious name like `<script>alert(1)</script>` could attempt to execute code in the user's email client.~~
- **Mitigation:** **[FIXED]** The `sendVerificationEmail` function now sanitizes all user-provided data before embedding it in the HTML email body, preventing the injection of malicious scripts.

### 3.2. SQL Injection (Largely Mitigated)
- **Current Mitigation:** The application consistently uses parameterized queries via the `pg` library (e.g., `client.query('... WHERE id = $1', [userId])`). This is the industry-standard defense against SQL Injection and is implemented correctly throughout the data access layer.
- **Potential Risk:** This is currently a low-risk area, but it's critical to maintain this discipline. Any future developer who deviates from this pattern and uses string concatenation to build a SQL query from user input would immediately introduce a critical SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** Enforce a strict policy of using parameterized queries for all database interactions. Code reviews should specifically check for this.

## 4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

- **Vulnerability:** Several actions rely on the client to provide the correct ID for an object (e.g., `deleteCommentAction(commentId)`). The security relies entirely on the server-side check that ensures the logged-in user is the `author_id` of that comment.
- **Risks:** As with decentralized authorization, if this ownership check is ever missed or flawed in a server action, a user could potentially manipulate objects they don't own by simply guessing IDs. For example, a malicious user could try to call `deletePostAction('some-other-users-post-id')`.
- **Recommendation:** Continue to be vigilant with ownership checks in every server action that modifies data. Centralizing these checks where possible would further reduce risk.

## 5. Lack of Rate Limiting
- **Vulnerability:** Several sensitive actions do not have rate limits in place.
- **Risks:**
    - **Brute-Force Attacks:** An attacker could rapidly try to guess a user's password or an email verification OTP.
    - **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker could spam the email verification endpoint, potentially incurring costs or getting the service blocked.
- **Mitigation:** **[PARTIALLY FIXED]** Rate limiting has been added to the following actions:
    - **Password Changes:** Limited to 3 attempts per day.
    - **Name Changes:** Limited to 1 change per week.
    - **Email Change Requests:** Limited to 2 requests per day.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a more robust, IP-based rate-limiting solution using a middleware or a dedicated service like Upstash for more comprehensive protection.
